## Features

- Working with fetch and AJAX to get some data from an external source

- Get this data from an API and take what I wanted from it with an iteration

- Display the result with Bootstrap classes to train this framework

- Add a form in order to make a dynamic search bar, fetching the result from [omdbapi](https://www.omdbapi.com/)


### Experiences learned

- working with API's

- fetching data from Internet

- trained Bootstrap

It was fun :)
